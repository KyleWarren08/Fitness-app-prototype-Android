# Fitness-app-prototype-Android-
I  created this app prototype as my first android app. This app allows a user to sign up and login, then they can input there physical details and begin making use of the app. The app allows users to set goals and input daily calories for each meal, while also being able to take a picture of each meal. Users can then view their calorie consumption in the form of a graph. Most functionality is present in the application but some features still need work however this is a prototype. A firebase database was made use of to host user information and images for the application.
